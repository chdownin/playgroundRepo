Alright so I need to fill this with something and my brain is full. 

If you want get the correct type of mechanical disk brakes for your bicycle, you first need to know if the frame supports disk calipers.
You can find this by just looking at the rear triangle near the left-side seat stay and looking for a tab welded/molded onto the frame.
There are two types currently: flat-mount and post-mount.
flat-mount frames only takes flat-mount calipers.
post-mount frames accept both flat- and post-mount calipers.
